# stock-rl

## Roadmap
- [ ] Dataset
  - [x] make sure current data available (so this can use the same set of data from training to production)
  - [ ] Prepare training data
    - [x] Get the first 140 stocks I'm currently following as list of symbols (All australian stocks with market cap at 2B no EOD 2024-08-11. Values stored in stock_list.txt)
    - [x] Get the data from 1970 for the stocks
    - [x] Save them into DF using h5py (size is smaller than I thought, only 60MB data)
    - [ ] Data cleaning, because the starting date of a lot of stock actually aren't as far back to 1980
- [ ] Investment
  - [ ] Set up investment account with a broker
- [ ] RL
  - [ ] make the dataset like RL gym
  - [ ] what are the observation space/ action space?
  - [ ] what we need to account for if this is partially observable MDP?
  - [ ] try different size of x axis of CNN filter
- [ ] Model
  - [ ] Read from arxiv.org for guidance

  - [ ] experiment
  - [ ] metric: Sharpe ratio? maximising chances of earning over a percentage?
  - [ ] toy with different parameter?
  - [ ] CNN with y dimension same as the number of features?
- [ ] Training
  - [ ] Colab -> Azure ML?
    - [ ] [Tutorial](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/tutorial-explore-data?view=azureml-api-2)
- [ ] Deployment
  - [ ] azure pipeline?
  - [ ] azure logic app? so that they are just apis?
  - [ ] my db to cache data from yfiance? (rate limit per day)
  - [ ] What app so I can use it easily?
- [ ] Automation
  - [ ] Find an API that would allow a background job to trade without manual input (seems like only US stocks are supported)
